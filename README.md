## Description
A CubeSat (U-class spacecraft) is a miniaturized satellite made for space purposes and is composed by multiples of 10 x 10 x 10 cm cubic units. CubeSats are commonly
put in orbit by deployers on the International Space Station, or launched as secondary payloads on a launch vehicle. The intent is to provide affordable access to space for the university science community, Government agencies and commercial groups thanks to a standardized design of the whole structure. In satellites, the attitude determination and control subsystem are the module which is responsible for maintaining, monitoring and controlling the satellite attitude against the environmental disturbances torques, which affect the satellite orientation and leads to angular destabilization of the satellite while it is in orbit. In this report design of attitude and control system for the 12 U cube-satellite which is at given orbit is presented.

## Mission Analysis and Design
### Mission Requirements and assigned Parameters 
Project requisites are given below in the table. 

| Requirements  | Details | 
|    :---:    |     :---:      | 
|Type of Cubesat | 12 U |
|Sensors | Sun sensor and Earth Horizon sensor |
|Actuators | 8 Cold Gas Thrusters and 4 Reaction wheels |
|Detumbling | starting with ! > 5deg/s;!final close to 0 deg=s |
|Tracking | Point to Sun with a pointing error Theta < 3 deg |
|Altitude | 500 km |

### Satellite physical properties
The selected spacecraft is in cuboid shape as shown in figure 1. It is assumed that the solar panels are not deployed yet. Various quantities such  as weight, length and moment of inertia are appreciated in the below table.

|Quantity | Value |
| :---: | :---:
| L*W*H* | 20 x 20 x 30 cm<sup>3</sup> |
| Weight | 25 Kg |
| J| 0.2666 ; 0.26; 0.1666 kgm<sup>2</sup> |

12 U Cubesat can be found in the Figure 1.

The stability of the system is verified as the condition J<sub>x</sub> > J<sub>z</sub> and J<sub>y</sub> > J<sub>z</sub> is met, J<sub>z</sub> being the minimum inertia moment. 

## ADCS Architecture
As Shown in the figure 2 ADCS of the Cubesat is composed of Central unit for Attitude control system which senses the surrounding environment via Sun sensor and Earth Horizon sensor along with Inertial Measuring unit made of gyros. Controlling part is carried out by two efficient actuators namely Cold gas thruster and Reaction wheels.

## Spacecraft Dynamics
In the analysis of a spacecraftâ€™s dynamics, orbital mechanics and attitude dynamics are decoupled due to their different time scales.

### Attitude Dynamics


### Orbital Mechanics

### Attitude Kinematics


## Disturbance Torques

The disturbances account for this project design are: Atmospheric drag; Gravity Gradient; Solar Radiation Pressure and Earth Magneic Field.

## Sensors
In this section a brief discussion on sensors is reported.

### Gyroscope
The gyroscope measures the angular velocity <span>&#969;</span>. It is running at a very high frequency so it is also subjected to noise and drift. Those can be modelled by a white noise n and a bias b whose derivative b is also a white noise. n is a zero-mean Gaussian noise
